- **Redis Cache** - Enabled by default for caching and WebSocket support
- **Railway S3 Storage Bucket** - Scalable, persistent file storage for multi-replica deployments
- **WebSockets** - Real-time features enabled by default
- **CMS Template** - Pre-configured content collections (pages, posts, forms, navigation, etc.) applied automatically
- **Extensions Marketplace** - Access to extensions and plugins for enhanced functionality
- **Health Checks** - Built-in monitoring and automatic restarts for Railway
- **Admin User** - Automatically created on first deployment with secure credentials
- **Frontend Integration** - Easy connection to Next.js, Nuxt, Astro, and SvelteKit starters
- **Production Ready** - Configured with best practices, security, and scalability in mind

## Use Cases

- **Content Management**: Enable teams to create, manage, and publish content without technical knowledge
- **API Development**: Build REST and GraphQL APIs from your database schema in minutes
- **Headless CMS**: Power websites, mobile apps, and other frontend applications with a flexible content API
- **Admin Panels**: Build custom admin interfaces for your applications
- **Data Management**: Visualize and manage data from any SQL database through an intuitive interface

## Quick Start

### Deploy to Railway

1. **Click the [Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/template) button above**
2. Railway will automatically:
   - Generate a secure `SECRET` (encryption key)
   - Set your `PUBLIC_URL` (from your Railway domain)
   - Provision a PostgreSQL database
   - Provision a Redis cache
   - Provision a Railway S3 storage bucket
   - Link all services to Directus via private network (zero egress fees)
   - Deploy your Directus instance
   - Create your admin user with secure credentials
   - Apply CMS template with pre-configured collections, flows, and dashboards
3. **Access your Directus admin panel** at your Railway URL

### Add a Frontend

Connect your Directus backend to Next.js, Nuxt, Astro, or SvelteKit starters from
[directus-labs/starters](https://github.com/directus-labs/starters).

**See [FRONTEND_ADDONS.md](./FRONTEND_ADDONS.md) for complete setup instructions.**

## Features

### Private Networking

All communication between services (Directus, PostgreSQL, Redis, Storage) happens over Railway's private network. This
means:

- **Zero egress fees** for database and cache operations
- **Secure** - services are not exposed externally by default
- **Fast** - private network communication is optimized

### Scalable Storage

Uses Railway's S3-compatible storage buckets for file storage:

- **Multi-replica support** - Share storage across multiple Directus instances
- **Persistent** - Files survive container restarts and deployments
- **Scalable** - No storage limits tied to container size
- **Automatic configuration** - S3 bucket is automatically provisioned and configured

### Automatic Setup

The CMS template includes automatic setup scripts that:

- Create admin user on first deployment with secure credentials
- Apply CMS template with pre-configured collections (pages, posts, forms, navigation, etc.)
- Install and configure popular extensions from the marketplace
- Configure S3 storage bucket automatically
- Set up health checks and monitoring
- Create sample flows and dashboards

## Development

### Local Development

Run Directus locally using Docker Compose with the same configuration as Railway:

1. **Navigate to directus directory:**

   ```bash
   cd directus
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables:**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your values
   ```

3. **Start services:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Access Directus:**
   - Admin Panel: http://localhost:8055
   - Admin credentials are created automatically if `ADMIN_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` are set in your `.env` file

**Note:** Local development uses local file storage by default. For S3 storage locally, configure the S3 environment
variables in your `.env` file (see `docker-compose.yml` for available options).

### Scripts

- `scripts/start-directus.sh` - Startup script that runs Directus bootstrap and optionally applies CMS template
- `scripts/bootstrap-admin.sh` - Admin user creation and template loading (CMS template only)
